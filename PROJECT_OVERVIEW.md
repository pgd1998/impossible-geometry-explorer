# Impossible Geometry Explorer
## Interactive 3D Journey Through Mathematical Paradoxes

### <¯ Project Vision

An immersive web experience that showcases impossible geometric objects - structures that can exist in mathematical representations but not in physical 3D space. This project demonstrates the intersection of mathematics, visual design, and interactive technology, perfect for a design engineering portfolio.

### <¨ Core Concept
